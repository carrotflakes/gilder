# Gilder

Gilder is a Rust library for golden testing.

Golden tests are a commonly used approach in software testing where the expected output of a test is stored as a reference (golden file) and then compared against the actual output of the test run. In short, it guarantees that changes don't alter the value your code produces. Gilder simplifies the process of implementing golden tests.

# Getting Started

To start using Gilder in your Rust project, follow these steps:

1. Add Gilder as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

``` toml
[dev-dependencies]
gilder = "0.1"
```

2. Write a new golden test using the Gilder API:

``` rust
#[test]
fn my_test() {
    use gilder::assert_golden;

    let target = something();
    assert_golden!(target);
}
```

`assert_golden!` macro is similarly to `assert_eq!`, but it accepts only one argument. The argument must implement the `ToString` trait.

3. Create golden files using Cargo:

Golden files are generated by running the tests for the first time.

``` shell
cargo test
```

A golden file with the `.gld` extension will be saved in the same directory as the source file containing the test code.

4. Testing:

Running the tests for the second time behaves like a normal test.

``` shell
cargo test
```

5. Updating the golden files:

Delete the golden files and rerun the tests.

6. Commit and version control:

Golden files should be committed to your version control system along with your source code. By tracking changes to golden files, you can easily review and manage modifications to your test outputs.
